# Guardian V2

Q: What is Guardian V2?

A: Guardian V2 is a side project of mine. Its purpose is to protect users from game/user-made malicious functions/scripts. It is highly customizeable so anyone could get the experience they desire. It is the next generation of Guardian and has gotten many new updates.

Q: Is Guardian V2 safe? Does it actually protect me?

A: Guardian is fully open source, and is completely safe. Those who want can just take a look at the source. However, nothing is truly 100% protective as there will always be flaws, but Guardian V2 is regularly undergoing detection patches/bug fixes to ensure the best performance and quality.
